# NorthCoders News

## Description

A front end news aggration board which allows the user to browse articles, filter by topic and organise by a number of queries. Upon logging in the user may interact with the board; add new articles, delete previously composed articles as well as comment and vote.

This app was built in react using JSX, CSS, HTML and is built upon a backend express server which acts as an API for a SQL database. The repo for the backend can be found here:

and is hosted by Heroku here:
